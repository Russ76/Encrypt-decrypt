# Encrypt-decrypt
Quick encryption of text files, and decryption

This pair of Python scripts will encrypt a text file and decrypt the same. It is very hard to distinguish any of the original text file in the “coded” version. However, it is not Military Strength! These scripts were just an exercise to learn more about the Python language and practice its use.

These scripts won’t work with “Word” or fancy files with formatting information, just plain vanilla text files, such as those saved by “Notepad” or “Notepad++” or such. (Note that Word seems to copy to clipboard a special apostrophe that is actually more than one character. Kindly correct these before running the scripts.)

The input file must be called “new_input.txt” and the programs must be in the same folder as your text file. Use the command line (in a CMD or terminal window):
Python encrypt-it.py
To do the encrypting. And
Python decrypt-it.py
To do the decrypting. This was tested on Windows 11 with Python 3.9 and on Ubuntu 20.04 with Python 3.8

The encrypted file will be called, “output_encrypted.txt” The output file from decrypting will be called “decrypted_code.txt”
Some text viewers may show the encrypted file as Chinese letters! Others will show that it isn’t so strange looking. If you encounter problems, contact me. Good luck, and have fun.
